# Programing-Langs-Project
This project is made for an university course homework
6.1 : Our only types in the SOL lang are Numbers and functions.
6.2 : Still strugle to modify it with one less param , Yet I used static call as we decided in class that it is more relible for the programer.
6.3 : In part 2 I did not used any tail-recurssion , but tail-recursion is better as it saves space by not holding the prev iteration in the recursion , and passes the progress to the current iteration.
6.4 : Because I zam construction a new global env , I needed it to be staticly stored for all inner scopes , using dynamic call would not work.
